# StandupBot
Slackbot for randomizing standup order. The setup for this is more complicated than the code. Basically you need to set up a lambda with the code from this repo, then set up an endpoint for the slackbot to hit. 

## Usage
In slack, type `/standuporder` followed by a series of names, to get a random ordering of the names
